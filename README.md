###Requirements
- Allow full custom-styled select elements, primarily through CSS
- Minimal additional markup
- Minimal js needed
- Retain (not recreate) native functionality like tabbing, keyboard control, and native dropdown menu
- Degrade gracefully for browsers that don't support (IE6 and IE7)

###To do
- Cross-browser fixes
- Smarter plugin implementation
